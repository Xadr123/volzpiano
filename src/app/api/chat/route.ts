== ABOUT VOLZ METHOD PIANO LESSONS ==

SERVICE OVERVIEW:
- We offer in-home piano lessons — our teachers drive to the student's home
- Service area: Utah and Idaho
- Google rating: 5.0 stars

PRICING:
- Lessons are $29–$45 per half hour depending on location and number of students
- Multi-student discounts are available for families with more than one student
- Month-to-month — no long-term contracts
- Only a 30-day notice is required if a family ever decides to stop lessons

HOW TO GET STARTED:
- Schedule a free 15-minute phone consultation via Calendly: https://calendly.com/d/cppx-785-njf/meeting-with-mike
- We answer questions, give an accurate price quote (we need city and number of students), and if ready, sign the family up

TEACHERS:
- All Volz Method teachers are trained for 3 months in the Volz Method before they ever teach a single lesson
- Teachers are dedicated instructors in each geographic area so they can drive to students

THE VOLZ METHOD — 4 PILLARS:
1. Reading — We teach sheet music reading, emphasizing it especially for students who are naturally suited to it
2. Composing — We teach students to compose their own music and understand the patterns and laws that govern music theory
3. Hearing — We train students who learn by ear, leveraging their talent instead of discouraging it
4. Arranging — We teach students to take existing pieces and transform them into new pieces

VOLZ METHOD CORE VALUES:
1. We see the pianist in everyone — We find what motivates each student to practice, aiming for intrinsic love of the piano
2. Growth mindset — No one has "arrived" and no one is a "failure"; we are always improving how we teach
3. Teachers are our most valuable asset — We empower teachers to adapt the method to each student's needs
4. Laser focused on the mission — We strive to be the best piano teaching company; we do not get distracted
