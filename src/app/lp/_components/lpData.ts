    q: "Is there a contract?",

    q: "My child has never played piano. Is that okay?",

  },
  {
    q: "I'm not musical myself — can I still help my child?",
    a: "Absolutely. Plenty of the parents we work with have never touched a piano. Each week your teacher leaves a simple, specific practice plan, so you never have to be the music expert — you just help your child show up and cheer them on.",
    group: "method",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you choose your teachers?",
    a: "Every Volz Method teacher goes through three months of Volz Method training as they begin teaching, and your child keeps the same teacher every week — someone who really gets to know them. Want the details on how we select and match teachers to your family? Just ask on your free call.",

  {
    q: "What happens on the free call?",
    a: "It takes about 15 minutes. We answer your questions, give you an exact price for your area, and — if you're ready — set you up with a teacher. No pressure either way.",
